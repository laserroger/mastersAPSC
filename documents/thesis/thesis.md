## System analysis
>Description of the application domain, existing tools, and functional analysis of a comprehensive application that will be helpful to the physicists.

The NNDC maintains the [NSR website](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nsr/) with simple search features.
They offer a quick search, and searching via text, keynumber, and various indexed key fields.
Each search function is hidden in either a separate interface or a drop down menu.


## Application
>Designing an interface for such an application

The proposed application attempts to unify the various search functions into a single web app interface.
Furthermore the app presents new types of analysis for the user.


## Algorithmic development
>Introduce and discuss the algorithms used in various application features

Starting with some of the naive algorithms, and then going to graph theory.
A review of graph theoretic concepts and piecing them together for the application on hand.


## Implementation
>Introduce and discuss the various technologies used.

Advantages and disadvantages of these technologies and justification of final choices.

- Gephi analysis, modularity, average shortest path


## Demonstration
>Demonstrate how the application can be used to perform analysis of the NSR.

Demonstration of the application.
How everything that was promised is delivered.
If certain things could not be delivered, why not.


## Results
>Conclude with discussion of contributions.

How the application uncovers some of the previously unknown and interesting results.
