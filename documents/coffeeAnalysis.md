#Coffee Drinkers

Applying social stereotypes to data analysis?

###Say the following is true:  
Group A likes local, independent fancy coffee shops.  
Group B likes Tim Hortons.  
Group A does not like Tim Hortons.  
Group B does not like fancy coffee shops.  
A new coffee shop opens up.  

Can we make good recommendations (positive or negative) for group B if we have data from Group A on the new coffee shop?

In a recommendation system, like Netflix, Airmiles, Amazon shoppers, can we cluster the customers and then make this sorts of associations?

"Recommended by you liked product A" Means people who bought/liked product A also bought/liked the following products.
In data sets where we have negative feedback as well, can we use that to actively rule out suggestions?


#Targeted/Reward based recommendations  
Can a system be built that could quantify a reward for missing information and thus make suggests to users in order to acquire high reward data points.
